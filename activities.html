				<h3>Cooking</h3>
				<p>As a college student, I've recently started getting into cooking. Before, I mostly relied on takeout and fast food to sustain myself, but I've come to realize that cooking my own meals is not only healthier but also a great way to save money. However, I must admit that I'm still very much a beginner in the kitchen. I'm still learning the basics of cooking and experimenting with different recipes to see what works best for me.</p>
